## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing data, encode categorical variables, and normalize features.
   - Feature engineering to identify critical data points influencing customer churn.

2. **Model Training**  
   - Train a deep learning model using TensorFlow on the preprocessed data.
   - Fine-tune the model with hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as **Accuracy**, **ROC-AUC**, **Precision**, and **Recall**.

4. **Real-Time Prediction**  
   - Users can input demographic and behavioral data into the Streamlit app for instant churn predictions.
   - Results are shown along with a confidence score and potential action steps.
